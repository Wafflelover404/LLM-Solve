Ai respond written to response.md !Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Include the iostream library for input and output

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;  // Output message to console
    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

### Explanation:
- `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the standard input/output stream library that allows you to use `std::cout` for printing.
- `int main()`: This is the main function where execution starts.
- `std::cout`: Used to output text to the console.
- `"Hello, World!"`: The string that will be printed on the screen.
- `std::endl`: Ends the current line and flushes the output buffer (similar to a newline).
